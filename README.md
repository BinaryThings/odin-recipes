# odin-recipes
First TOP Project
Welcome to my first project with The Odin Project!
This project is a basic recipe website. By the time this project is completed, I should understand the basic HTML boilerplate, formatting of text, inserting of hyperlinks and pictures, and using GIT to track changes from start to finish.
